About
=====
`Dabit Industries <https://dabit.industries>`_ is the official reseller of the latest `ROS <https://www.ros.org>`_ based development platform - TurtleBot3. We want to help our customers to quickly understand how to get started programming the TurtleBot3. The usual requirements are to have a background in Linux, software engineering and some bit of robotics. Now, we want to introduce **Blockly** and make the TurtleBot3 much easier to program while having fun.

`Blockly <https://developers.google.com/blockly/>`_ is a free and open source web interface that can be used to program the TurtleBots. Its intuitive drag-and-drop based programming style welcomes everyone to try out the logic based programming and is easy to get started. 

We will help you understand the required concepts necessary to work with Blockly and get your TurtleBot up and running in no time!

You can order the TurtleBot3 `here <https://dabit.industries/collections/turtlebot-3>`_.

There are two variants of this TurtleBot3 - `Waffle <https://dabit.industries/products/turtlebot-3-waffle>`_ and `Burger <https://dabit.industries/products/turtlebot-3-burger>`_.
Make sure to check them both out.
