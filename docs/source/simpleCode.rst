A Simple Program
================

Let's write a simple program to make the TurtleBot3 do the following tasks:

1. Move forward for two seconds
2. Wait for one second
3. Move backward for three seconds
4. Wait for one second

Drag and drop blocks
*********************

Launch the Blockly web interface and ensure that TurtleBot3 is connected to the master (your pc/laptop).

In the Blockly web interface on the left sidebar you will find ``Dabit-Turtlebot3`` icon. Click on it and drag a ``Move_Forward`` block onto the workspace. It should look something like this image.

Our task is to move the TurtleBot3 for two seconds, so change the seconds field to ``2`` and let's run it at a **NORMAL** speed. Look at the image below for reference.

The following figure shows the remaining steps to complete the program.
You will find the ``Wait 1 seconds`` block inside the ``Control`` icon on the left sidebar.
